Hello! My name is Jackson Thomas Freedom Ennis! I was born and raised in South Bend, IN. You're probably looking at my name and going, "Huh, thats a pretty weird name". And yeah, you'd be right - but its because I was raised in a family of people who had strong ideals. I was actually named after Jackie Robinson, the man who broke the color barrier. Believe it or not, my first name was going to be Freedom, but my mom decided against it because she didn't want me to get bullied in school.

I love to learn new things and participate in novel and exciting things. Growing up I always loved nature and now as an adult I am known to dissapear into the nearest woods alone for hours on end.

For me, nature is a great place to be alone with your thoughts - and reflect on how your life is going, so I always like to go there when its a beautiful day out. For me, getting lost is the hallmark of a great adventure.

Computer science for me is the answer to my curiosity and drive to make things. With CS there is so much variety in what you can do and I love making new things and do so often in my spare time.
