The autonomous stock trader uses data generated from the Analyst on a large number of stocks to generate an output of predictions and accuracy for those predictions. These predictions are tabulated into a .csv and then are analyzed by the day trader. The day trader then uses a heuristic to determine which stocks to buy as well as which ones should be sold. The trader then makes these trades automatically. The program runs automatically without any user input.
