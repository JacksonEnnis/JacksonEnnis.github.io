I am currently minoring in Animal Behavior because I really like the subject but I think that its very helpful with computer science because it helps me recontextualize a lot of problems I encounter in coding.

I am also a certified Wilderness First Responder, mostly because I thought it'd be a cool class to take. But I do think that it's helped me learn how to work under pressure and make plans in times of stress.
