Origonally, this project was called "Dead Man's Trigger" because I had gotten the idea from one of those fast paced action movies where there is some sort of hostage negotiation going on and the terrorist says something along the lines of "If you shoot me my hand will go off this bomb trigger and it'll blow everyone up." I thought my app was kinda like that, so thats what I named it. I later changed it to "Safety Net" because it sounded a lot less like a death threat.
